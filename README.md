# game_2048

This is a small project to redo the game 2048 on a smartphone.
As a first step, I have done this project on normal coding environment (Console and Java) in order to get a better feeling of that little game.
Before going to Terra Incognita!

I have lots of knowledge for backend and console applications, the challenge, for me, is to port this little game to my Android phone,
and my iPad.
I am a total novice on the development of these platform.
As a first step, I did a console interface. For the moment it works on macOS, I didn't check on Linux, but it should work too.

I use SpringBoot 2, Java 8 and macOS Mojave (10.14) for my development.
For SpringBoot, I wanted to use the SpringShell in order to use the nice tables in ASCII.
I could use other frameworks, less huge... I know, but I wanted to refresh my mind with that framework, since I will be using it a lot in the future.

I know that iOS needs Swift or ObjectiveC. I will do it in Swift.
Concerning Android, java or kotlin can be used. I will do it in Kotlin.

This is also a challenge, because I am not very good with Swift/Kotlin, even if I know the basis.
So this first project is done 100% in Java, so I know what are or not the challenges that awaits me :-D
And I have a code base to look at, when I am stuck!
